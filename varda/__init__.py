# On the event of a new release, we update the __version_info__ and __date__
# package globals and set RELEASE to True.
# Before a release, a development version is denoted by a __version_info__
# ending with a 'dev' item. Also, RELEASE is set to False (indicating that
# the __date__ value is to be ignored).
#
# We follow a versioning scheme compatible with setuptools [1] where the
# __version_info__ variable always contains the version of the upcomming
# release (and not that of the previous release), post-fixed with a 'dev'
# item. Only in a release commit, this 'dev' item is removed (and added
# again in the next commit).
