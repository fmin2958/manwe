Varda client
============

A command line interface to Varda server, a database for genomic variants.

**This is a work in progress, not ready for use!**


Description
-----------

Varda is an application for storing genomic variation data obtained from next-
generation sequencing experiments, such as full-genome or exome sequencing of
individuals or populations. Variants can be imported from standard formats
such as [VCF](http://www.1000genomes.org/wiki/Analysis/Variant%20Call%20Format/vcf-variant-call-format-version-41)
files, or annotated for presence in previously imported datasets.

Varda is implemented by very loosely coupled components, communicating using
a RESTful protocol over HTTP with json-encoded response payloads.

* *Varda server:* Exposes a RESTful API for managing and querying the variant
    database.
* *Varda client:* Command line client for querying the server
    non-interactively.
* *Varda web:* Web interface for browsing the server interactively.

This is Varda client.


Varda client
------------

The simple command line client can be used for administrative tasks, such as
importing very large VCF files. It is non-interactive and therefore suitable
for use from existing scripts and pipelines. Communication with Varda server
is done using the [Requests](http://python-requests.org) library.


Running Varda client
--------------------

Create a Python virtual environment and install the requirements:

    $ mkvirtualenv --no-site-packages varda-client
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the client with the -h argument for usage information:

    $ python -m varda.main -h


Documentation

Todo (surprise, surprise).
